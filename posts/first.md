`git init`

Welcome to my wordrepo. It's a blog. Actually I hope it's more than a blog. A
place to talk about ideas, projects im working on, tips-n-tricks or anything on
my mind. A
[brain dump](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/brain%20dump), perhaps.
Hopefully more tidy.

I should have had set my own website up a long time ago. If I can keep it as
freeform as possible, with as little rigidity as possible, hopefully I wont feel
obligated or pressure to engage. Might be why I never started in the first place

`git push origin main`
